        <h2>Step 1: Retrieve the Card ID</h2>

			To delete a card, you first need to retrieve its ID. Make a GET request to the following endpoint:

			Once you have the Card ID, make a DELETE request to the following endpoint:
		</p><code>https://api.trello.com/1/cards/{cardID}</code>
        <p>
			Replace <code>{cardID}</code> with the ID of the card you want to delete.
