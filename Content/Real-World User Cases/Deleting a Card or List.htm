      <p>
        This section demonstrates how to delete a card from your Trello board using the Trello API. Follow the steps below to understand the process, illustrated with screenshots.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1: Retrieve the Card ID</h2>
      <p>
        To delete a card, you first need to retrieve its ID. Make a GET request to the following endpoint:
      </p>
      <pre><code>https://api.trello.com/1/cards/{cardID}</code></pre>
      <p>The response will include the card's details, including its ID.</p>

      <h2>Step 2: Delete the Card</h2>
      <p>
        Once you have the Card ID, make a DELETE request to the following endpoint:
      </p>
      <pre><code>https://api.trello.com/1/cards/{cardID}</code></pre>
      <p>
        Replace <code>{cardID}</code> with the ID of the card you want to delete.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Set the <strong>HTTP method</strong> to <code>DELETE</code>.</li>
        <li>Enter the endpoint with the appropriate Card ID.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Send</strong> to execute the request.</li>
      </ol>
