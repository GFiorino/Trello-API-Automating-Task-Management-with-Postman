        <h1>Deleting a Card</h1>
        <p>
            This section demonstrates how to delete a card from your Trello board using the Trello API. Follow the steps below to understand the process, illustrated with screenshots.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Step 1: Retrieve the Card ID</h2>
        <p>
            To delete a card, you first need to retrieve its ID. Make a GET request to the following endpoint:
        </p>
        <pre>https://api.trello.com/1/cards/{cardID}</pre>
        <p>The response will include the card's details, including its ID.</p>

        <h2>Step 2: Delete the Card</h2>
        <p>
            Once you have the Card ID, make a DELETE request to the following endpoint:
        </p>
        <pre>https://api.trello.com/1/cards/{cardID}</pre>
        <p>
            Replace <code>{cardID}</code> with the ID of the card you want to delete.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Set the <strong>HTTP method</strong> to <code>DELETE</code>.</li>
            <li>Enter the endpoint with the appropriate Card ID.</li>
            <li>Click <strong>Send</strong> to execute the request.</li>
        </ol>
